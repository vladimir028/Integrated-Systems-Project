# PVSTravel
The goal of this project is to develop an application that represents travel packages and itineraries offered by travel agencies. Through PVSTravel, users can easily explore various travel packages, where each package comes with its own unique itinerary and planned activities. Travel agencies using PVSTravel can create and offer multiple packages, each with detailed descriptions of the trip and activities included throughout the journey.

The application was built using .NET Core with onion architecture, ensuring a modular and maintainable system. This approach provides high flexibility and a clear separation of different layers within the application, making it easy to upgrade and extend functionalities. The project also includes a separate admin panel that allows agencies to manage their packages efficiently.
